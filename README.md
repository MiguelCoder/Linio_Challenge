# Linio Challenge

- This project was implemented in PHP 7.2.18

- In order to run EntityManagerTest you must have Composer (a PHP dependency manager) installed on your computer.
- After installing and adding Composer as an environment variable of your O.S., you'd like to access the project folder via prompt and execute the following command: ". \vendor\bin\phpunit tests". It might run the EntityManagerTest PHPUnit's tests and return its status.
  
- For more information on testing with PHPUnit + Composer check out the following link:
